## Features
The web application has multiple features. It can allow a user to create an account and login to the system. A registered user can book an appointment with a doctor, where they can also update or cancel the appointment they booked. After the user books an appointment, the doctor can choose whether to approve or reject the appointment. The doctor also has the choice to update or cancel the appointment after they have approved it. The doctor has the ability to create his own schedule and it can be displayed when the appointment is being booked or updated.
\
The application has an admin panel to which the admin has the authority to perform crud operations according to the models available. A user can apply to become a doctor to which the admin can choose whether to approve or reject the application.
\ 
There is also an email sending feature to alert the user whether his appointment has been approved or rejected by the doctor, and also when the userâ€™s doctor application has been approved or rejected by the admin.
